# Nano-AI-PBPK-G1
First generation AI-assisted PBPK model for nanoparticles.

This repository contains the raw data and code files for our first generation AI-assisted PBPK model for nanoparticles. The manuscript title is "An artificial intelligence-assisted physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model to predict nanoparticle delivery to tumors in mice". This manuscript will be submitted soon. Please refer to our manuscript for details about this model when the manuscript is published.
